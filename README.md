# STEPS Decision Aid Tool

**STEPS (Scalable Training Estimation and Planning System)** is an interactive, user-friendly tool that helps decision makers plan and scale Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) in India. It predicts programme uptake, performs a detailed cost–benefit analysis, and evaluates willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for key programme attributes—all in USD.

## Features

- **Intuitive Tab Interface:** Navigate among Introduction, Instructions, Attributes, Inputs, WTP Results, Predicted Program Uptake, Costs & Benefits, and Scenarios.
- **Attribute Cards with Icons & Tooltips:** Each programme feature is displayed on a card with an SVG icon; hover for more details.
- **User-Friendly Inputs:** Input cards show selected levels and baseline (reference) levels. Responsive sliders allow granular adjustments for cohort size (500–2000 in 250 increments) and cost per participant (USD 500–6000).
- **Realistic Predictions:** Coefficient estimates (from literature) produce realistic uptake probabilities.
- **Detailed WTP Analysis:** A bar chart shows extra value (in USD) for each attribute level compared to a baseline.
- **Cost–Benefit Analysis:** Interactive bar chart and summary table with detailed educational explanations:
  - **Costs:** Calculated as (Cohort Size × Training Cost), including fixed costs (e.g., local press ads, printing, postage, administrative personnel, trainer fees, on-costs, facilitator salaries, material costs, venue hire, session time, travel) and variable costs.
  - **Benefits:** Estimated from QALY gains (assumed 0.05 per participant) multiplied by $50,000 per QALY.
- **Scenario Management:** Save full scenarios (all input selections, predicted uptake, net benefit), compare them, and export a PDF report.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Layout adjusts seamlessly for desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works

1. **Attributes:**  
   - Review each programme feature via visually appealing cards with SVG icons and tooltips.
2. **Inputs:**  
   - Set your scenario using input cards that show the available levels (with reference levels indicated) and responsive sliders.
3. **Calculate & View Results:**  
   - Click "Calculate & View Results" to update the predicted uptake, WTP chart, and cost–benefit analysis. A brief feedback message confirms processing.
4. **Predicted Program Uptake:**  
   - View a doughnut chart with the predicted uptake percentage and recommendations (e.g., if uptake is low, consider reducing cost or improving accessibility).
5. **WTP Results:**  
   - See a bar chart comparing the extra value (in USD) for each attribute level versus its baseline.
6. **Costs & Benefits:**  
   - Review a detailed cost–benefit analysis: a bar chart shows total cost, benefit, and net benefit; a summary table lists all cost components (with unit cost, quantity, and total); and an educational summary explains the calculations.
7. **Scenarios:**  
   - Save your current scenario. Each saved scenario displays all input selections, predicted uptake, and net benefit. Compare scenarios and export a PDF report.
